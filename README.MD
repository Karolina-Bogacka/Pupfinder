## PUPFINDER

### A revolutionary solution for dog shelters and stalkers

Have you ever seen a cute dog on the street and thought "Man, I wish I could take you home"?
Well, now you can!

Our powerful service allows you to instantly check your neighborhood for any reported homeless dogs, wherever you are, 
whenever you are.

Can't deal with any more muzzles to fill? Do something good for the pupper and report it, so that
someone else may pick it up instead!

### Quick start

As an unauthenticated user, you will be able to access the home page and search for new puppers.
To start, enter your current location in the search map or just click on it to precisely establish 
the place.

You can search for dogs there either by clicking Enter, or pressing on the button Go to location.
If you wish to identify a puppy, hover your mouse over a chosen marker to see its photo and basic 
information about it. You can also look for puppies chronologically, by clicking on the button with
a specific id.

The spot you have chosen can also be used to report a puppy. However, in order to use it you have to login.
(If you have no account, you have to register beforehand). You can also log out later by clicking on the appropriate button.
